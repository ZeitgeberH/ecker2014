%% Current source density
%
% Here we compute the current source density (CSD, second spatial
% derivative of LFP) to identify the location of layer 4.
%
% Simply assuming that within one recording all tetrodes were at the same
% depth and averaging them did not produce convincing results when I tried
% it. This is probably because there were different amounts of tissue
% dimpling when inserting the tetrodes and in addition there was some
% variability in how much we adjusted each tetrode after each recording.
%
% I noticed that in one monkey the magnitude of the off-response of the LFP
% has a characteristic pattern across depths that is fairly consistent
% across tetrodes. I used this pattern to estimate the depth of each
% tetrode relative to the others. In combination with our notes about how
% far each tetrode was adjusted after each recording this should give me a
% fairly reliable estimate of the depths.
%
%   * In two of the three monkeys we seem to get a decent source/sink
%     pattern where we expect layer 4.
%
%   * The off responses aren't quite as consistent between the two monkeys.
%     However, since I used features from the off responses to align the
%     tetrodes and get decent and consistent CSD profiles for the on
%     responses makes me pretty optimistic about these results.

%% CSD debugging in first monkey
%
% We don't get a decent CSD profile for the first monkey, presumably
% because of the way we referenced in this monkey: we used a tetrode in
% white matter as the reference. Presumably that tetrode changed its
% position due to tissue movement when adjusting the other tetrodes,
% resulting in quite different evoked LFP responses from one recording to
% the next. Also, it could be picking up different signals related to how
% deep the anesthesia was in different sessions.
%
% The script below illustrates the average evoked LFP responses for each
% recording along with the first four components of a space-time SVD, which
% pretty nicely capture the differences in the on responses from one
% recording to the next. Since it doesn't change smoothly over time but
% seems to oscillate back and forth it seems unplausible that these changes
% are actually related to the depth in cortex.
